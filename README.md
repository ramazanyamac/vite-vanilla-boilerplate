# vite-vanilla-boilerplate

I have created a boilerplate using the Vite.js framework for building HTML pages. The boilerplate includes a structure where Tailwind CSS and SCSS can be used together. You can modularize the SCSS and JavaScript files to write individual page components separately. Feel free to update the file directory to fit the structure of your project. As an example, I have generated two HTML pages, which you can replicate according to the needs of your project.
